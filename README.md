This is a proxy motor-behavior recognition task (arm-flapping / head-banging / spinning vs. no stereotypy) built on a public research dataset. It is not an autism diagnostic or screening tool, has not been clinically validated, and must never be described as one.

# SSBD self-stimulatory behavior recognition

Lightweight scaffold for a research-oriented repository focused on proxy motor-behavior recognition from public dataset video.

Current scope:

- repository structure only
- no data download or ingestion code
- no MediaPipe, modeling, validation, or training implementation

Planned top-level layout:

- `src/ssbd_behavior/` Python package
- `tests/` minimal smoke tests
- `scripts/` future utility entry points
- `configs/` future experiment and runtime configuration
- `docs/` supporting documentation

Data and generated artifacts are intentionally excluded from version control.
